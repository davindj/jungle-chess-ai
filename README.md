## Background
Jungle Chess AI project is the final project in the Artificial Intelligence course. All students were assigned to make a good and competitive [Jungle Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jungle_(board_game)) AI, and that AI will fight against each other. Students are allowed to use any algorithm.

My team decided to use the [Minimax Alpha Beta Pruning algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha%E2%80%93beta_pruning), one of many algorithms in Game Theory. This algorithm will calculate n-step ahead, evaluate every possible state in the game, and decides to choose the best option.
